 * Testcase Example:  '["Hello","Alaska","Dad","Peace"]'
 *
 * Given an array of strings words, return the words that can be typed using
 * letters of the alphabet on only one row of American keyboard like the image
 * below.
 * 
 * Note that the strings are case-insensitive, both lowercased and uppercased
 * of the same letter are treated as if they are at the same row.
 * 
 * In the American keyboard:
 * 
 * 
 * the first row consists of the characters "qwertyuiop",
 * the second row consists of the characters "asdfghjkl", and
 * the third row consists of the characters "zxcvbnm".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["Hello","Alaska","Dad","Peace"]
 * 
 * Output: ["Alaska","Dad"]
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * Both "a" and "A" are in the 2nd row of the American keyboard due to case
 * insensitivity.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["omk"]
 * 
 * Output: []
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: words = ["adsdf","sfd"]
 * 
 * Output: ["adsdf","sfd"]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= words.length <= 20
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 100
 * words[i] consists of English letters (both lowercase and uppercase).Â
