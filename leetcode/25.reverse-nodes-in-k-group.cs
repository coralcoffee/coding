 *
 * Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time,
 * and return the modified list.
 * 
 * k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the
 * linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out
 * nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
 * 
 * You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may
 * be changed.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
 * Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
 * Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the list is n.
 * 1 <= k <= n <= 5000
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow-up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?
